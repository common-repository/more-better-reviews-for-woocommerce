**The plugin "Get better reviews for WooCommerce" provides follwing great features and advantages to your own e-commerce business:**

* Rating stars at Google
* Higher click-through rates on your landing page
* Redirections of reviews depending on the rating of the customer to avoid negative reviews
* Greater credibility of the product reviews
* Improved product descriptions
* Higher costumer confidence in your products
* High flexibility:
	* 4 modi are possible: Only WooCommerce, WooCommerce and Trusted-Shops, WooCommerce and Klick-Tipp, WooCommerce and Klick-Tipp and Trusted-Shops
	* Creates an individual html template for each woocommerce customer.
	* Lifetime free usage of all features (for a limited amount of review requests generated per period).

= Details of some of the most important plugin features =

* Your customers' ratings are likely to automatically appear with stars in Google's organic search results. For you, this means that Google adds stars to your page and that attracts more visitors from Google.
* Through the links in the rating request emails, customers will rate on your own generated review page. This minimalistic site is automatically created by the plugin and contains all recently purchased products.
This has the advantage that your customers can easily and quickly submit reviews and very likely rate several products at once.
* Further noteworthy is the possibility to forward customers based on the given rating stars. This  is done by linking the stars and buttons in the e-mail.
Example: 1-3 star ratings will be redirected to your support contact form, and those with 4-5 stars will be linked to the rating page.
**That leads to more better reviews** and less unsatisfied customers.**

= Following features are connected with the different modi possible within the plugin: =

* For a higher delivery rate, and thus, higher review rate, transfer your rating requests to Klick-Tipp and let KlickTipp automatically send the emails via the ready-made campaign. Select Klick Tipp for sending the emails in the "email and page" tab
* For a greater credibility of your reviews, link the rating requests emails with trusted shops and publish reviews in the portal. Please insert the Trusted Shops log-in-information in the settings tab.
* For more product confidence, show the Trusted Shops reviews in your store by using the Vendidero theme and plugin (Dennis)

PS: See screenshots attached how the request email for product reviews can look like
